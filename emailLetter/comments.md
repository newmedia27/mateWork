## Comments to letter:

### All:
- center is a depracated html tag - please replace it with align attribute
- font-family: Verdana;font-size: 13px;font-weight: bold;text-decoration: none;color: #46b4da; - this properties inherit from parent so you can only add to it to the top table, not to each link 
- I think that whole table according to the maket should have a grey border on the left and on the right
- font-family: Verdana => better write: font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;
- it's better to add tbody in table before adding tr and td to it

### Header:
- I think that in the header the right menu should be a little bit higher, because in the psd logo and menu is on the same base line, in your case it lower than expected

### Center:
- Information about seller and buyer: the left td should be more wide, add more padding to right column
- 300$ - should not be bold
